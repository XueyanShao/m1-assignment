          <h2>Why Adopt a Dog or Cat Over Buying?</h2>
          <p>
            Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here
            looking to adopt a pet? Pet adoption is quickly becoming the
            preferred way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten. Best of all,
            there are so many benefits when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat over
            buying. For instance, pet adoption will almost always be more
            affordable than buying a puppy for sale from a breeder or finding a
            kitten for sale from a litter. There are more benefits as well.
            Since pets in rescues and shelters usually come from a home where
            the owners ran out of money, got divorced, or had to move, it's
            common to find that the dogs and cats on our website are already
            housetrained, good with kids, or do well with other pets. People are
            finding out that buying a puppy for sale from a breeder isn't all
            it's cracked up to be, and the dogs and cats don't leave the
            organization without having their shots and being taken to the vet.
            That means less stress, and more savings! So what are you waiting
            for? Go find that perfect pet!

          <h2>The Experts & Tools You Need to Find the Perfect Pet</h2>
          <p>
            Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for?
            Wait a second, did we just say personality, and not breed? Yes, that
            is right. Finding the ideal pet for yourself or family should start
            with an understanding of the ideal pet personality. Consider this,
            do you need a dog that is low key and good with kids, or are you
            looking for an energetic pal who is into trail running? Perhaps a
            cat that will get along well with others is what you need. The dog
            rescues and cat rescues that post hundreds of local pets near you
            are experts at matching you with a dog or cat who will love the life
            you can provide. This is why so many people are realizing focusing
            on dog adoption and cat adoption from a rescue is the ideal pet
            search process. Best of all, our website has a feature called "New
            Pet Alert." Simply tell us what you are looking for and we will
            email you when that perfect pet is available! So even if you've made
            the commitment to adopt a puppy or adopt a kitten, we will email you
            immediately when we know of a local little furry fellow who is in
            need of a new home!
